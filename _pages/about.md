# About Me

Hello, I am Xinyi Hou (侯心怡). I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), as a member of the **SECURITY PRIDE** Research Group (**Security**, **Pri**vacy, and **De**pendability in Emerging Software Systems), under the supervision of Prof. [Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree at Northeastern University (NEU) in June 2023. 

My research interests include, but are not limited to, the **security of large language model (LLM) applications**. Specifically, my work focuses on LLM app stores, LLM agents, model deployment, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

If you would like to reach me, please email [xinyihou AT hust DOT edu DOT cn](xinyihou@hust.edu.cn).
