# üç¶ About Me

Hi, there! I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), under the supervision of Prof. [Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree at Northeastern University (NEU) in June 2023. 

My research interests include but are not limited to LLM+SE.

If you would like to reach me, please send an email to [xinyihou@hust.edu.cn](xinyihou@hust.edu.cn).

Here are my close friends' homepages: [Yanjie Zhao](https://yanjiezhao96.github.io/), [Shenao Wang](https://ShenaoW.github.io/), [Liu Wang](https://liuer-wang.github.io/), [Ningke Li](https://ningke-li.github.io/)...
