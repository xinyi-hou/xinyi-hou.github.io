# üç¶ About Me

Hi, there! I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), under the supervision of Prof. [Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree at Northeastern University (NEU) in June 2023. 

My research interests include but are not limited to LLM4SE and VR Security.

If you would like to reach me, please send an email to [xinyihou@hust.edu.cn](xinyihou@hust.edu.cn).
