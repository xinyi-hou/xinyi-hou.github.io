# üç¶ About Me

Hi, there! I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), under the supervision of Prof. [Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree at Northeastern University (NEU) in June 2023. 

My research interests include but are not limited to LLM Application Security and LLM + SE.

If you would like to reach me, please email [xinyihou@hust.edu.cn](xinyihou@hust.edu.cn).
